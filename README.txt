# OS161-Investor-Producer-Synchronization:

1. Read Problem Description carefully to understand the problem.

 & Read Second Part of Design Document to understand the solution properly.

2. Unzip asst1.zip and go to directory $ asst1/src/kern/asst1 here you will see the following files: 
    1.invest_assignment.c  
    2.invest_assignment.h
    3.investor_producer.c
    4.investor_producer.h
you have to complete the function in investor_producer.c according to the demand of invest_assignment.c.

3.Solution is on the Solution Folder.Just replace the "investor_producer.c" and "investor_producer.h" files in asst1/src/kern/asst1 with the files situated in Solution Folder (With same name). 

4.To compile you need to run the Compile.sh file.to do so run the following 2 commands in terminal
    $ chmod -R 777 Compile.sh  //to change the permission.Need to run only once. 
    $ ./Compile

5.Then Run the os-161 by: 
    $ chmod -R 777 Run.sh   //to change the permission.Need to run only once.
    $ ./Run 

you should see the following:

Teacher's Feedback: 
#################################################
Teacher said everthing is ok except 2 thinks. 

1.There was a condition that a producer can take at most 1/3 of a order.to do so
we split every order in equal 3 size in order_item() funtion.He said not to split it.Instead
take 1/3 orders of the of total currently placed order,if you understand the solution properly 
hopefully you can implement it. 
2.He asked to use semaphore for every bank explicitely.
